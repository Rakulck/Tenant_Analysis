 # Tenant Default Analysis Platform

## Overview

The Tenant Default Analysis Platform is an AI-powered real estate risk assessment system that analyzes rent roll documents to predict tenant default probabilities and provide actionable insights for property managers and real estate investors.

## Current System Analysis

### Core Functionality

The existing system consists of several key components:

#### 1. Document Processing Engine (`TenantDefaultAnalyzer.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Processes rent roll documents (PDF, Excel, CSV, Numbers) up to 25MB
- **AI Integration**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o for document analysis and risk assessment
- **Web Search**: Integrates real-time macroeconomic data via OpenAI's web search capabilities
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), CSV, Apple Numbers

#### 2. Type System (`tenant-default-analysis.ts`)
Comprehensive TypeScript schemas defining:
- **Risk Severity Levels**: low, medium, high, critical
- **Payment Patterns**: on_time, occasionally_late, frequently_late, consistently_late, in_arrears, no_payment
- **Next Action Types**: monitor, contact_tenant, payment_plan, formal_notice, legal_consultation, eviction_process, unit_preparation
- **Tenant Information**: lease details, financial data, risk factors
- **Analysis Results**: comprehensive assessment data with confidence levels

#### 3. API Interface (`route.ts`)
- **POST /api/tenant-default-analysis**: Main analysis endpoint
- **GET /api/tenant-default-analysis?info=capabilities**: System capabilities endpoint
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection via Upstash Redis
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with processing time metrics

#### 4. User Interface (`page.tsx`)
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop rent roll document upload
- **Property Information**: Form for property details and location data
- **Real-time Analysis**: Progress tracking and status updates
- **Results Dashboard**: Interactive table with filtering, sorting, and export capabilities
- **Risk Visualization**: Color-coded risk levels and probability bars

### Analysis Process

1. **File Validation**: Checks file type, size, and format compatibility
2. **Property Context**: Extracts property information and location data
3. **Macroeconomic Research** (Optional): Real-time web search for:
   - Local unemployment rates
   - Economic indicators
   - Industry trends
   - Seasonal employment patterns
4. **AI Analysis**: OpenAI GPT-4o processes the document with context
5. **Risk Assessment**: Generates individual tenant risk profiles
6. **Recommendations**: Provides actionable next steps with timelines and priorities

### Current Limitations

- **No Persistent Storage**: Analysis results are not saved
- **No User Management**: Stateless processing without user accounts
- **No Historical Tracking**: No comparison with previous analyses
- **No Property Management**: No way to organize multiple properties
- **Limited Collaboration**: No sharing or team features
